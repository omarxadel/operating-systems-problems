# Operating Systems Problems

This repository is dedicated to Operating Systems problems as a topic. All the problems in this repository were solved by me as class work for Operating Systems course at Alexandria University as part of my Computer and Communications Bachelor's Degree. This was in 2020 but I did not share them until now. All of these problems were solved on Linux.

Most of the code was lost because I was working on a Virtual Machine so it was gone when I changed my computer and I had no backup sadly. I will leave a note beside each project with missing code but I will leave the report.
